Understanding the problem:
    The goal of this project is to create a sign-up page. In this page, form controls and client-side validation
    will be used to allow a user to fill out a dummy sign-up form. This form will not be sent to a server and is
    meant to practice newly learned form validation and markup skills.

Plan
-------
Does your program have a user interface? What will it look like? What functionality will the interface have?
    Yes. The interface will be on the browser as a form. It will have labels above the input fields as well as
    placeholder text to show the user the desired input. Invalid inputs will be displayed with red background and
    valid inputs will be displayed with a green background. The user will be able to submit their form with a submit
    button. 
What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?
    The program will take in first and last name, email, phone number and a password. The user will have to provide
    this information manually.
What's the desired input?
    Desired input would be a valid first and last name (length greater than 0), a valid email (based on type email),
    a valid phone number (based on pattern validation) and matching passwords.
Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?
    1. Validate there is some input in the first name field
    2. Validate there is some input in the last name field
    3. Validate the email field has an input of type email
    4. Validate the phone number field matches the pattern for a phone number
    5. Validate the passwords match each other

Steps: 
//Display required input type text with a label of first name
//Display required input type text with a label of last name
//Display required input type email with a label of email
//Display input type tel with a label of phone number
//Display required input type password with a label of password
//Display required input type password with a label of confirm password
//Display a submit button
//Validate first name is over minlength of 0
//Validate last name is over minlength of 0
//Validate phone number matches pattern of phone number
//Validate passwords match
//Display a message if the passwords do not match
//Format valid inputs to have a green background in the input field
//Format invalid inputs to have a red background in the input field
//Display a background image
//Format sign up form to have a white background over the background image
//Format labels to appear over input
//Display a light div over background image to hold text
//Display text in div over background image
//Display a logo next to text in div over background image
//Display photo credit over the background image
//Display author credit in a footer
